            <h2>What is Apache Hadoop Ozone?</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                Ozone is a new subproject of Apache Hadoop. It provides an
                 object store semantic (something like s3) for Hadoop.</p>
            <p class="lead">It's based on HDDS (aka Hadoop Distributed Data Storage)
               which is an other new for Apache Hadoop. It provides a storage
               layer for other higher level componets (such as Ozone)

                <p>
                 Ozone is designed to scale to tens of billions of files and
                 blocks and, in the future, to every larger number of
                 smaller objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Small files or huge number of datanodes and block reports are
                  no longer problems.

                    Using of RAFT protocol has allowed the storage layer to
                    be self-consistent.

            <h2>Question and Answers</h2>
            <h3>Where can I download it?</h3>
            <p>Apache Hadoop Ozone is not yet released. It's developed on
              the trunk branch of Apache Hadoop. And short-term will be released
            independently from the main Hadoop release.</p>
            <h3>How can I contribute</h3>
            <p>The contribution process is the same with any other
              <a href="https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute">
                Hadoop subproject.</a></p>
            <h3>Does it mean a new Hadoop server component?</h3>
              <p>The worker part of Ozone/HDDS can be started as a HDFS
                Datanode plugin. Both Ozone and HDDS requires one additional
                master component (Ozone Manager and Storage Container Manger)
            </p>
            <h3>How can I try it out?</h3>
              <p>There is a
                <a href="https://www.katacoda.com/elek/scenarios/ozone101">katacoda</a>
                which could be used. Please note that it contains
                 a demonstration verison which is not released by Apache.</p>
              <p>For the Apache version you can download and build the latest versoin
                from trunk</p>
