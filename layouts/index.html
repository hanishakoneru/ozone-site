            <h2>What is Apache Hadoop Ozone?</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                Ozone is a new subproject of Apache Hadoop. It provides an
                 object store semantic for Hadoop.</p>
            <p class="lead">It uses Hadoop Distributed Data Storage (HDDS) for storage layer. HDDS is 
             another new subporoject of Apache Hadoop.

                <p>
                 Ozone is designed to scale to tens of billions of files and
                 blocks and, in the future, even more.

                  Small files or huge number of datanodes are no longer a limitation.

                    Storage Layer uses RAFT protocol for consistentency.

                  is a new component based on the HDDS storage layer which
                  could provide raw device access to Kubernetes or any
                  other CNI compatible cloud solutions.

            <h2>Question and Answers</h2>
            <h3>Where can I download it?</h3>
            <p>Apache Hadoop Ozone is not yet released. It's being actively developed on
              the trunk branch of Apache Hadoop. It will be released independently from
              the main Hadoop release.</p>
            <h3>How can I contribute</h3>
            <p>The contribution process is the same as is for any other
              <a href="https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute">
                Hadoop subproject.</a></p>
            <h3>Does it mean a new Hadoop server component?</h3>
              <p>Both Ozone and HDDS requires one additional master component - 
               Ozone Manager and Storage Container Manger, respectively. The 
               worker parts of Ozone/HDDS can be started as a HDFS 
               Datanode plugin. 
            </p>
            <h3>How can I try it out?</h3>
              <p>There is a
                <a href="https://www.katacoda.com/elek/scenarios/ozone101">katacoda</a>
                which can be used to try out Ozone. Please note that this is for 
                demostration and is not released by Apache.</p>
              <p>For the Apache version, you can download and build the latest version
               from <a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop">trunk</a></p>
